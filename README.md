## Webpack 2 + MarionetteJS + Babel/ES6

Started with a modern JS skeleton with MarionetteJS for [Webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org/) from https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette-integrations/tree/master/webpack2

* Install:
    * Inside this folder run: `npm install`
* Run:
    * `npm start` â€” starts project
    * `npm run build` - builds you project
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` and `app/styles/` to `public/`.
